## Level 1
### Task 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
Explore dataset structure and quality.
Determine rows and columns.
Handle missing values.
Perform data type conversion.
Analyze "Aggregate rating" distribution for class imbalances.

### Task 2: Descriptive Analysis:
Calculate basic stats (mean, median, etc.) for numerical columns.
Explore distribution of categorical variables like "Country Code," "City," and "Cuisines."
Identify top cuisines and cities with most restaurants.

### Task 3: Geospatial Analysis:
Visualize restaurant locations using latitude and longitude.
Analyze restaurant distribution across cities/countries.
Explore correlation between location and rating.


## Level 2

### Task 1: Table Booking and Online Delivery
Determine the proportion of restaurants offering table booking and online delivery services.
Compare average ratings between restaurants with and without table booking facilities.
Analyze the availability of online delivery across different price ranges.

### Task 2: Price Range Analysis
Identify the most common price range among all restaurants.
Calculate average ratings for each price range.
Determine the color representing the highest average rating among different price ranges.

### Task 3: Feature Engineering
Extract additional features from existing columns, such as restaurant name or address length.
Create new features like "Has Table Booking" or "Has Online Delivery" through categorical variable encoding.

## Level 3

### Task 1: Predictive Modeling
Develop a regression model to predict restaurant aggregate ratings using available features.
Split dataset into training and testing sets; assess model performance with relevant metrics.
Experiment with diverse algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forest); compare performance.

### Task 2: Customer Preference Analysis
Investigate the correlation between cuisine type and restaurant rating.
Determine popular cuisines based on customer votes.
Identify cuisines associated with higher ratings, if any.

### Task 3: Data Visualization
Employ visualizations to illustrate rating distribution through histograms, bar plots, etc.
Compare average ratings among different cuisines or cities using appropriate visualizations.
Visualize feature relationships with the target variable to derive insights.
